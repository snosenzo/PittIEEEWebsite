                        I have been a student member of IEEE since the fall of my sophomore year and I am now a senior; this club has grown significantly since I joined! IEEE has exposed me to so many opportunities such as tutoring, scholarships, mentoring, technical workshops, leadership experience, and, of course, friendships. I am so grateful to have had IEEE as such a huge part of my undergraduate career.
                        <br>
                        As Co-President, I am responsible for mentoring officers to succeed in their positions, delegating responsibilities when necessary, keeping track and updating official club documents, and planning out each semester's calendar of events by collaborating with the board of officers.
                        <br>

                        Fun fact: outside of school, I love hiking, photography, and trying new foods.</p>

                        I am currently a sophomore electrical engineering major pursuing minors in computer science, Chinese, and bioengineering. As treasurer, I submit budgets, present funding requests, and organize fundraisers. To me, IEEE is a great introduction to the students, faculty and resources within the ECE department. Outside of school, I enjoy science fiction, tae kwon do, and trying new restaurants with friends.
                        <br>Fun fact: I have watched every episode of Avatar: The Last Airbender at least twice. I can be reached at zoe.toigo@pitt.edu</p>
